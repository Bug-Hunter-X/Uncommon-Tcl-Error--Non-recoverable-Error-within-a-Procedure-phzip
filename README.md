This repository contains a Tcl code example demonstrating a potential error handling issue and its improved solution. The `bug.tcl` file shows the initial code with a non-recoverable error scenario, while `bugSolution.tcl` presents the improved version utilizing the `try...catch` mechanism for better error management. This example highlights the best practices for robust Tcl error handling.
